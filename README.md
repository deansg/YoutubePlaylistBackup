# YoutubePlaylistBackup
A CLI for backing up YouTube playlist video names to a text file, used in case videos change/get deleted

Usage:
1. Get a Youtube API Key. To do so, you can follow the instructions here: https://elfsight.com/help/how-to-get-youtube-api-key/
2. Retrieve the YouTube id of the playlist you want to create a backup for. This can be done in several ways. One of them is by navigating to the playlist's main YouTube page, and copying the text after "...list=" in the url
3. Run the CLI (more on the CLI syntax is provided by running the help command)
